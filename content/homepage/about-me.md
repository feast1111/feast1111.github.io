With my lifelong passion for health and wellness, my main goal is to assist people in achieving weight loss and overall well-being. Through my personal journey with weight and health challenges, I discovered that refined carbs and sugar are major culprits. With a basic knowledge of macro-nutrients and micro-nutrients and what their role is, you can easily adapt your current eating habits to achieve your weight loss and improved health goals.

We are a family who loves to go rock-climbing, mountain biking and hiking.
