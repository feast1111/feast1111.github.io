I am dedicated to guiding clients through the overwhelming maze of information and helping them find practical solutions that work for them. My approach involves providing motivation, uncovering the reasons behind emotional eating, and supporting the adoption of a new and sustainable lifestyle, one step at a time.

A personalized eating plan and/or a list of good foods and a list of bad foods. Adapted to your lifestyle. With weekly support and motivation. 

When someone is very overweight, strenuous exercise will only increase stress hormones and lead to fat storage. Instead, opt for a refreshing walk around the block, which will be more beneficial. As you regain a healthy weight, you will start liking exercise and movement again.

The focus is to choose food in its natural state. Your body knows what to do with natural foods. Eat less of the foods that have ingredient lists.
