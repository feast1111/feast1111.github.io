title: "Fructose: Sickeningly sweet for the liver"
---
Fructose is similar to alcohol, but without the hangover. What the two have in common is where they’re “handled”; both are metabolized by the liver. Unfortunately, the liver has very limited options for metabolizing fructose and alcohol; much of what isn’t used for energy production is converted to fat. 
Just as alcohol causes Fatty liver disease, high fructose consumption is a potent contributor to NAFLD (Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease).
A study published in 2009 explored the effect of fructose versus glucose on visceral fat (belly fat). *¹ 
The subjects all gained fat, but the interesting fact was where the fat accumulated. The fructose drinkers gained more visceral fat. Fruit juice is not a healthy drink!!! It is a potent source of pure fructose. Unfortunately, our misunderstanding is a significant part of why NAFLD is on the rise in children as well as adults *² 
Because of its fibre content and relatively lower fructose, whole fruit is very different from fruit juice. So eat some fruit, don’t drink it.
