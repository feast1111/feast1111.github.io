<p>Insulin resistance is a main cause of obesity. But it can be prevented and even reversed.
Even if your doctor has never brought up the subject of insulin resistance, you may still have it.
If you answer yes to one of these questions, you most likely have insulin resistance.
If you answer yes to two or more of these questions, the chances are even higher that you have insulin resistance.
•	Do you have more fat around your belly than you’d like?
•	Do you have high blood pressure?
•	Do you have a family history of heart disease?
•	Do you have high levels of blood triglycerides?
•	Do you retain water easily?
•	Do you have patches of dark-coloured skin or little bumps of skin (skin tags) at your neck, armpits, or other areas?
•	Do you have a family member with insulin resistance or type 2 diabetes?
•	Do you have PCOS (polycystic ovarian syndrome; for women) or erectile dysfunction (for men)?
