<p><code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Hugo-Scroll</code> theme alternates colors of sections that are placed on single page. 
The landing screen is meant to be visually striking.</p>

<p>Single-page approach is oriented towards small to medium content length, that won’t overwhelm the user. 
You can also delegate lengthier, less important or more sizeable content to <a href="services">dedicated pages</a>.</p>
