<p>Feature notice: This section displays options to customize title:</p>
<ul>
  <li>has a normal section title (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">title</code> = “The Services I Offer”),</li>
  <li>custom welcome screen title (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">header_menu_title</code> = “Services”),</li>
  <li>custom navigation menu title (<code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">navigation_menu_title</code> = “My Services”).</li>
